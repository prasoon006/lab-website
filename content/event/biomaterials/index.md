summary: The path towards a sustainable future requires a transition from the current linear, extractive, toxic construction practices, towards circular, bio-based, renewable materials and methods. This shift has the potential to dramatically reduce the natural resource needs and carbon footprint of growing cities and infrastructure, and critical to deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact. This UNEP & Yale CEA-hosted event offers an in-depth discussion in biomaterails and launches our most recent Biomaterials report.


abstract:  The path towards a sustainable future requires a transition from the current linear, extractive, toxic construction practices, towards circular, bio-based, renewable materials and methods. This shift has the potential to dramatically reduce the natural resource needs and carbon footprint of growing cities and infrastructure, and critical to deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact. Construction with bio-based and biomaterials can act as carbon storage, as materials sequester CO2 emissions while growing, helping to regenerate soils in between cultures and during the life of the building. Moreover, biomaterials could positively impact human health and wellbeing, by improving indoor air quality and the thermal comfort of occupants. Bio-based and biomaterials have the potential to generate new industries and employment. Given that certain biomaterials are locally sourced or context-specific, opportunities for job creation and technological innovation would take effect at the local scale, supporting local economies and societies, while reducing the harmful impacts of large-scale material transport. Overall, Bio-based and biomaterials have the potential to directly contribute to 10 of the 17 SDGs. However, a transition to a bio-based economy must be grounded on sustainable criteria to prevent deforestation, harmful land-use change and the loss of biodiversity. Supporting policies, safeguarding mechanisms and incentives must be put in place to accelerate the uptake of sustainably sourced, circular bio-based and biomaterials, while scaling-up production. Awareness raising, capacity building and multi stakeholder collaboration are needed to develop demand, a skilled workforce for implementation, and all segments of the needed value chain.This session seeks to raise awareness of the transformational socio-economic and environmental impacts that an accelerated transition to a bio-based, circular material economy could have, particularly for the Global South. Experts from governments, academia and the private sector will discuss opportunities, challenges and best practices on their development and use, as well as strategies to accelerate their uptake.
