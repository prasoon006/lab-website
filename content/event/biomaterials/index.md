abstract:  The Yale Center for Ecosystems in Architecture (Yale CEA) unites researchers across multiple fields in the development of transformative systems for the Built Environment. Alongside our partners in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry, we seek to fundamentally re-inform the built environment process, and develop methods for buildings and cities that support biodiversity and resiliency through clean energy, water, and materials. Yale CEA takes a unique approach to transdisciplinary research by leveraging the ongoing knowledge explosion in life sciences and information technology to prioritize the requirements of both human and extended living ecosystems.
