I am a Master of Architecture candidate at Columbia University GSAPP, and hold a Bachelor of Architecture from McGill University. I am part of the digital platforms team on the ReCONstruct project, and acting as a liaison with the DataHomebase project, with which I was involved in 2021.
I have experience in product design and manufacturing, as well as architectural research. My sustainability research has largely been focused on life cycle and energy assessment, while m design work focuses on computation and the exploration of the impacts and relationships between users and the built environment. I enjoy being outdoors as much as possible, whether it be mountain biking, kitesurfing, or backcountry skiing.
