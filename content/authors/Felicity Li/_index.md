I am an undergraduate student at McGill University pursuing a Bachelor’s in Architecture. As part of the Data Homebase project, I mainly focused on life cycle assessment of archetypal housing models across Canada. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the project’s standardization of information to encourage a circular economy. Throughout my studies, I have explored sustainable building practices and heritage architecture. In my spare time, I enjoy urban sketching. My work has been awarded the Wilfred Onions and Stuart A. Wilson Prize by a committee of staff of McGill’s School of Architecture in the annual Sketching School.
