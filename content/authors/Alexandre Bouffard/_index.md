I am currently an Architecture Student (B.Sc Arch, 2021-…) and Research Assistant at Mcgill University.  I graduated from a B.A in Studio Arts at Concordia University (2021) and worked in parallel in the construction industry as well as in construction waste management for the city of Montreal. My focus is the link between architecture, accumulation, global economic systems and how they affect the biosphere. Furthermore, I am interested in the socio-metabolic systems that lead to economic disparities and the implication of architecture in the maintenance of such systems.
