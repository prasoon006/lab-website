 Is this program for me? </br>
Architecture students are interested
in the arts, but also have strong skills
in math and physics. Above all, they
have a passion for imagining new
worlds, and for creating objects and
drawings as a means to communicate
their ideas about buildings, cities, and
landscapes.
Coursework
and research areas
The first year includes a range of
general science and humanities and/
or social science courses. Québec
CEGEP and university transfer
students typically receive oneyear advanced standing, entering
directly into U1. In subsequent years,
students take courses in architectural
design, construction, structures,
sustainable development and climate
change mitigation, and architectural
history. The curriculum is structured
around core design studio courses,
given each semester, in which
students work on increasingly
challenging design projects as they
progress though the program. Once
completed, students present their
work publicly to a panel of guest
reviewers. The program also includes
field trips and the opportunity to
study abroad.
