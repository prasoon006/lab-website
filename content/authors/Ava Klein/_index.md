I recently completed my Bachelors of Arts at McGill University in Geography (Urban Studies) and Art History. I previously worked as a proofreader for Professor Friedman and Professor Keenaâ€™s monograph on circular economy for the built environment for the CMHC and am currently with the Data Homebase Project, writing on the same topic. In my undergrad I worked with the bicycle planning company, Copenhagenize, as well as completed an internship with the Institute of Health and Social Policy at McGill, exploring the relationship between neighborhood densification and public health & wellbeing. I am planning to complete my Masters degree in Urban Planning in the coming years. As an aspiring planner, my research interests lie in the intersection between urban planning, architecture, and public health.
