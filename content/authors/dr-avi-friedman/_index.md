In 1988 he co-founded the [Affordable Homes Program](http://www.homes.mcgill.ca/) at the McGill School of Architecture, where he is a Professor. 

Dr. Friedman’s research interests focus on factors which influence the design and implementation of affordable and sustainable building practices at the unit and community levels, including market acceptance, construction, and resource efficiency. He is the recipient of several research  [awards.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/awards.pdf), including the Progressive Architecture Research Award, the J.-Armand-Bombardier Prize for Technological Innovation, and the Manning Innovation Award of Distinction.

As part of his research, Avi Friedman has designed  [housing_prototypes.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/housing_prototypes.pdf) which were built as full-scale demonstration projects and were then constructed by homebuilders in the private sector around the world. The Grow Home (co-designed with Witold Rybczynski), a narrow-front rowhouse, received immense media attention and has since been built in numerous communities across North America and Europe. The Next Home, also the subject of much positive media scrutiny, was incorporated into the design of communities in Canada and the U.K. La Casa a la Carta, presented in Mexico, was designed for the developing world. 

Dr. Friedman’s design work and projects have been cited in many books and have been covered extensively by [popular_media.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/popular_media.pdf): on TV shows such as Good Morning America, Dream Builders and Stewart Brand’s How Buildings Learn (British Broadcasting Corporation), in magazines such as Popular Science, Architecture and Home, and in newspapers including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and San Francisco Examiner.
