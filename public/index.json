She combines life cycle approaches to design with data visualization and computational techniques as a means to assess socio-ecological factors in architecture and to transform complex data streams into organized knowledge. Keena has published and presented her research widely in the areas of architecture, data visualization, life cycle approaches and circular economy, design-driven interdisciplinary research, and environmental policy. Her recent scholarship on circular economy in the built environment contributed to the UN One Planet Network, Sustainable Building and Construction (SBC) Programme’s ‘Global State of Play: Circularity in the Built Environment’ 2020 report where she authored the regional report for North America. She has published her research in conference proceedings, peer-reviewed journals, book chapters and research reports including: the AIA/ACSA Intersections Research Conference: Carbon; World Sustainable Built Environment conference; the Journal of Ecological Modelling; the Journal of Electronic Imaging; a book chapter in ‘Embodied Energy and Design’ as well as research reports for the ENEL foundation and UN Environment. Keena’s research has led to the development of many data and computational frameworks. One such framework is Clark’s Crow, a parametric tool that aims to promote awareness of the impact of different architectural design options through a biophysically-based ecological accounting method in the early stages of design-development. Working in an interdisciplinary realm, Keena co-founded another such framework named SEVA (Socio-Ecological Visual Analytics), a proposed new conceptual network of analytical techniques designed to quantify, visualize, characterize, and communicate socio-ecological factors within our built environments. Her doctoral research on SEVA was part of a large interdisciplinary effort named “Data Journey” which received three grant awards from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and was showcased at the international Grand Challenges meetings in New Delhi, London, and Washington D.C. Currently, SEVA technology is used by amongst others, the UN Environment’s World Environment Situation Room and the UNCCD Great Green Wall project and was showcased at the 2020 World Economic Forum. At McGill, Keena currently teaches in the third-year design studio. The primary aim of her design pedagogy is to bring a shift towards ecosystem design thinking through a set of courses, seminars and studios, layered with the diversity of interdisciplinary and systems thinking. She has previously taught environmental design, advanced graduate studio and PhD seminars at Yale School of Architecture and undergraduate studios and graduate level computational design modules at the School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, UK. Keena has also mentored computer science and architecture students through the undergraduate research program at RPI. Prior to joining McGill, Keena was a scientific researcher and postdoctoral associate at Yale Center for Ecosystems in Architecture (Yale CEA), and lecturer at the Yale School of Architecture. As a founding member of Yale CEA, Keena worked on numerous research projects in the areas of data visualization and immersive environments as well as biomaterials and circular economies, and represented the center at numerous international events including the UN Habitat 10th World Urban Forum, Abu Dhabi. At Yale CEA, she completed, in collaboration with Gray Organschi Architects, UN Environment and UN Habitat, the Ecological Living Module (ELM) to address the challenges of both climate change migration and the need for affordable housing in the face of rapid urbanization. This ecological modular home was showcased on the UN Plaza in NYC during the High-Level Political Forum to demonstrate how onsite clean energy, water, indoor air quality, urban micro-farming, bio-based renewable materials, and waste management could be integrated into the housing unit itself. The ELM won several awards, including Architect Magazine’s Residential Architect Design Award in 2018. Keena’s post-doctoral research on data visualization contributed to a body of work including the design and development of Yale CEA’s BEEM lab immersive visualization environment at Yale School of Architecture as well as serving as track chair for Immersive Visualizations at IEEE Games, Entertainment and Media (GEM) Conference 2019, Yale University. She holds a professional architecture degree from University College Dublin, Ireland, a M.Sc.

One such promising approach is that of circular economy which envisions a future where CRD waste is designed-out of the built environment by keeping construction materials in use.\nThe city of Montréal is one of many cities worldwide who strive to cut the amount of waste they generate and advance towards zero waste in an effort to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Construction, renovation and demolition (CRD) waste is a major contributor to urban waste streams but also an area where waste diversion and innovative waste management approaches could deliver significant reductions in waste. One such promising approach is that of circular economy which envisions a future where CRD waste is designed-out of the built environment by keeping construction materials in use. This research project seeks to answer three questions: (1) How best can CRD waste be eliminated?; (2) Which circular economy principles and methods could be effective in ensuring sustainable CRD material management and implementation for Montréal?; and (3) What kind of stakeholder partnerships are necessary to advance towards zero CRD waste? These questions are in keeping with key principles outlined in Montréal’s master plan, titled « Montréal, objectif zéro déchet », to guide and enable CRD waste recovery. These principles involve (1) stimulating a circular economy and (2) mobilizing relevant stakeholders. To advance these principles, accessible and reliable data on the current status of CRD waste in Montréal is necessary. However, existing and emerging literature in the area of circular waste management is typically siloed, disconnected and fragmented making it difficult to access and therefore, to assist with informed, evidence-based decision-making. Data visualization offers a powerful potential means to create engagement with this data by relevant stakeholders. However, before we can visualize and invite engagement with the relevant data we must first collect and organize it. This project will collect pilot data through a variety of methods: (1) a detailed literature review and a series of surveys and semi-structured interviews with policymakers, designers, contractors, end-of-life contractors, waste haulers, reuse organizations, developers and citizen groups; (2) life cycle assessment (LCA) modeling; (3) mapping of the collected data to the internationally recognized United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework; and (4) compilation of key circular design principles. The collected data will be integrated and disseminated via an original prototype, named Circular CRD, using new forms of data visualization. Advancing towards zero CRD waste in Montréal will require the input of multiple stakeholders. This project aims to deliver an initial but vital first step in the collection, integration and dissemination of data via a novel interactive data visualization prototype to (1) highlight key circular economy measures to enable sustainable material management and (2) stimulate relevant stakeholders through engagement and interaction with the data. In short, this project acts as a springboard in the development of a new research avenue which explores the promising potential of using data visualization as a means to engage partnerships and enable interdisciplinary research towards facilitating a circular, more sustainable, built environment.\nThis research is funded by the Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Société et Culture (FRQSC)\n","date":1653415066,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653415066,"objectID":"1f83f8d149106e9202e66cee37fa4ea7","permalink":"http://127.0.0.1:5501/project/circular-crd/","publishdate":"2022-05-24T17:57:46.822Z","relpermalink":"/project/circular-crd/","section":"project","summary":"Laying the foundation for constructive stakeholder engagement on improving construction, renovation and demolition (CRD) waste management.

CE is when materials and buildings are kept in use for as long as possible to reduce waste and promote sustainability, and end of life building material is reused, rather than turned to waste.\nHowever, effective CE decision-making requires robust, building data. Unfortunately, this is currently scattered and lacks standardization.\nTo overcome this barrier, for Round 1 of the Housing Supply Challenge, McGill University has proposed to develop ‘housing passports’ (HP) - standardized digital descriptions of residential building characteristics.\nEach HP will represent different residential typologies based on analysis of existing building stock. Through a new web-based, data visualization prototype named Data Homebase, HP information will be organized, semantically linked, and visualized in a manner that makes it easily accessible to a wide variety of housing stakeholders, from building sector, to financial and policymaking actors. For example, HPs could help banks complete property assessments and could support cities with asset management of government housing.\nhttps://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/project-funding-and-mortgage-financing/funding-programs/all-funding-programs/housing-supply-challenge/round-1-housing-supply-challenge/data-driven-funding-recipients#MUDH\n","date":1653415066,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653415066,"objectID":"7c5bdf61996b772b99a8a8bcb5e1b9f7","permalink":"http://127.0.0.1:5501/project/data-homebase/","publishdate":"2022-05-24T17:57:46.822Z","relpermalink":"/project/data-homebase/","section":"project","summary":"One approach to tackling housing supply is the circular economy (CE).
