Avi Friedman began his architectural studies at the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, received his Bachelor of Architecture from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in 1980 (first in class/cum laude) and his Master of Architecture from McGill University in Montréal. Between 1982 and 1984, Dr. Friedman worked as head of design for a homebuilding firm in Montréal. He received his Doctorate in 1987 from the Université de Montréal. In 1988 he co-founded the [Affordable Homes Program](http://www.homes.mcgill.ca/) at the McGill School of Architecture, where he is a Professor. 

Dr. Friedman’s research interests focus on factors which influence the design and implementation of affordable and sustainable building practices at the unit and community levels, including market acceptance, construction, and resource efficiency. He is the recipient of several research  [awards.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/awards.pdf), including the Progressive Architecture Research Award, the J.-Armand-Bombardier Prize for Technological Innovation, and the Manning Innovation Award of Distinction. 

Avi Friedman has published extensively in both academic and trade publications. He has  [authored_books.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/authored_books.pdf), wrote  [peer-reviewed_articles.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/peer-reviewed_articles.pdf) and[ ](http://files/architecture/Friedman05conferences2011.pdf) [conference_papers.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/conference_papers.pdf) on subjects ranging from construction technology to suburban planning and space management, for academic journals and conferences. Dr. Friedman is a member of the editorial board of architectural journals and authored  [research_monographs.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/research_monographs.pdf) and articles in trade publications in the U.S. and Canada. Since the year 2000, he has written a syndicated column called Forward Thinking for the Canwest chain of daily newspapers. 

As part of his research, Avi Friedman has designed  [housing_prototypes.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/housing_prototypes.pdf) which were built as full-scale demonstration projects and were then constructed by homebuilders in the private sector around the world. The Grow Home (co-designed with Witold Rybczynski), a narrow-front rowhouse, received immense media attention and has since been built in numerous communities across North America and Europe. The Next Home, also the subject of much positive media scrutiny, was incorporated into the design of communities in Canada and the U.K. La Casa a la Carta, presented in Mexico, was designed for the developing world. 

Dr. Friedman’s design work and projects have been cited in many books and have been covered extensively by [popular_media.pdf](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/popular_media.pdf): on TV shows such as Good Morning America, Dream Builders and Stewart Brand’s How Buildings Learn (British Broadcasting Corporation), in magazines such as Popular Science, Architecture and Home, and in newspapers including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and San Francisco Examiner.
