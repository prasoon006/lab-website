  Housing to Data "

summary: "Naomi Keena, PhD As the rates of urbanization increase to
  unprecedented levels, the urgent need for sustainable housing and
  infrastructure has become a widespread global challenge with social, economic,
  and ecological implications. The housing sector, and its value chain, directly
  impacts the majority of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals
  (SGDs). However, managing interconnections within the Built Environment
  Process (BEP) value chain poses many challenges. This is typically due to the
  siloed nature of the building sector which follows a material throughput,
  linear economy. This facilitates a culture of take-make-waste and lacks
  incentives for collaboration and exchange across the value chain. One
  promising approach in rethinking current siloed models within the BEP, is that
  of circular economy (CE) which envisions a sustainable future where waste is
  eliminated in the built environment and materials and buildings are kept in
  use for as long as possible. A CE approach to housing can go beyond solely
  waste recovery. This talk will present an approach to exploring CE in the
  built environment via building practices (a built case study) and data-driven
  approaches (a web application). It will highlight the need for both new
  circular building practices as well as their data-driven counterpart towards
  understanding and linking the complexity of the BEP value chain and supporting
  low-carbon and cost-effective decision-making. By unlocking the potential of
  CE principles in the built environment, this research holds potential
  significance to CE methods and evidence-based decision-making, amendments to
  policy and building codes, and the creation of incentives for cross-industry
  collaboration towards a sustainable and progressive future. TISED mobilizes
  knowledge to educate and influence public policy around sustainability working
  with McGill University's engineers, architects, and planners. TISED promotes
  bold and green ideas through education, outreach, and research, where we aim
  to connect our institution with the public for a greater understanding of
  sustainability issues in our society. "
