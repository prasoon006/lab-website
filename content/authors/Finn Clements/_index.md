Finn is going into his U3 year of his Bachelors at the McGill University School of Architecture.  While he is still early on in his architectural education, he has greatly enjoyed developing his own designs and artistic style, valuing a representation style with a bold graphic identity that strives to combine many types of media, both digital and analogue.  He hopes to continue his academic career at a masters program in Europe, possibly with a focus on industrial and furniture design.  He strongly believes in the importance of promoting low-carbon, sustainable and energy efficient design in architecture, and he is extremely grateful to be a part of such a crucial and necessary research project.
