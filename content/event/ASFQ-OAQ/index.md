summary: In the context of the climate and ecological emergency, the objective of this day is to encourage professionals in the field of architecture and planning to adopt more sustainable practices thanks to the circular economy.


abstract:  The program, developed thanks to the expertise of Architecture Sans Frontières Québec, will bring together some fifteen professionals from Québec, Canada, France and Belgium who will present innovative practices and case studies corresponding to the major stages of the cycle of building life. The recent file of the magazine Esquisses, “Towards a circular architecture”, already gives a foretaste of the issues raised. This symposium is part of the approach The architect facing the socio-ecological transition, initiated by the Order in the fall of 2021.
