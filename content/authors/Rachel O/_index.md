I am an undergraduate student at McGill Universityâ€™s School of Architecture. I am part of a team focusing on research regarding the pursuit of a circular economy in our building industry, seeking a more sustainable and responsible approach to future design and construction methods. My research consists of understanding the concepts and creating corresponding graphics and diagrams which support and analyze the ideas through visualizations. My interest revolves around traveling and experiencing new cultures while at the same time appreciating the traditional buildings blended within the cities.
