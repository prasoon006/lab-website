I am an architectural designer and researcher. 
At McGill, I work on a variety of research topics, mostly striving to develop stakeholder engagement towards the implementation of a circular economy in the built environment. I am a project manager for the Data Homebase, a CMHC funded data-driven initiative which aims to develop a web-based platform for standardized and organized information, namely Housing Passports, as well as data visualization tools to enable circular economy decision-making for housing across Canada. 
My personal research interests revolve around how tools of architectural production and representation affect our conception of the timeframes we design in. I am interested in developing computational and theoretical frameworks designed to navigate dictates of immediacy and conceive architecture(s) within contemporary conditions of uncertainty and doubt. 
In parallel, I also collaborate with MOS Architects, based in NYC.
