I am an undergraduate student and research assistant at McGill, working with my team to investigate and describe the sustainable strategies in the design of our built environment through the lens of circular economy. My research focuses on finding circular solutions to our global affordability crisis, and presenting built examples to highlight the benefits and the possibilities of life cycle design. I’m personally interested in the study of vernacular architecture, relating to passive design strategies and environmentally and culturally sustainable thinking. Apart from my studies and research work, I enjoy playing rugby, spending time in nature, and discovering a new favorite café.
