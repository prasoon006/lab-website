I am an undergraduate student in architecture and research assistant at McGill University, currently studying and synthesizing a variety of topics pertaining to circular economy in the building industry. My research focuses on methods of reconfiguring building practices through analyzing Housing Passports and data visualization tools, in an effort to promote a more sustainable approach to design. I am personally interested in the interdisciplinary nature of architecture; throughout my studies, I have explored issues of sustainability, heritage conservation, as well as inclusivity and accessibility. Beyond school and research, I enjoy painting, philosophy, and travelling.
